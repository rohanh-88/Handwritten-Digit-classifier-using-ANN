# Handwritten-Digit-classifier-using-ANN
This a neural network implemented to recognise handwritten digits. CNN has been employed for feeding the images to the neural network and feature detection. A personally created dataset is used. Increasing the datasets size will aid in training the neural network more efficiently. 
Mnist dataset also can be used by making the relevant changes
